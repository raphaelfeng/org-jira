# Contributing

## Bug Fixes

Please file an issue - if possible, file a PR that fixes it.

## Feature Requests

In general, any feature update that doesn't break backwards compatibility or cause
a significant maintenance/testing burden would be a welcome addition.

Please file an issue and make a PR that adds it.

if you'd like to run it past the community prior to coding, that is
fine too, however if the extent of the contribution is "pitching an
idea" to an issue that you have no intent to implement, it will be
closed after some time, if it is not followed up with a PR in a timely
manner.
